Simple Note

A simple note pad app that is made for quick and simple text entry.

It's the android notepad: No styles, no formatting.

No remote server is snatching up your notes for cloud storage where who knows might be looking over them. This app will not be taking up your bandwidth nor doing sneaky things in the background.

Just write a darn note. Saves on your sd cad as a plain old txt file. Back it up yourself. 

Does one thing and does it well.
